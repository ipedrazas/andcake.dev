andcake.dev Website, because it had to be a website 🤷‍♂️

For those who don't know me, I like cake... and I tend to mention it quiet often in any conversation. Why? because life is better with cake (if you ask me).

The idea came when I was thinking about how to improve my homelab and don't ask me how, I ended up thinking about cake, so cake it is. Now I can have services like [proxmox.andcake.dev](proxmox.andcake.dev) or [nextcloud.andcake.dev](nextcloud.andcake.dev)
